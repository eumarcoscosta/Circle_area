# Circle Area 

This program calculates the area of a circle using the formula \( A = \pi \cdot R^2 \), where \( \pi \) is approximated as 3.14159. The program takes a single floating-point number (double precision) as input, which represents the radius \( R \) of the circle. It then computes the area using the given formula and prints the result, formatted to four decimal places. The output is in the form of `A=` followed by the calculated area, ensuring a newline character at the end to avoid any presentation errors.
